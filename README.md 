# Booking System API

This repository contains a minimal skeleton for the booking system API used in coding tests. 
The project is a .NET 8 application with basic entities for users, packages, class schedules, bookings, and waitlists.

The `docs/dbdiagram.dbml` file provides the database schema in [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/d/booking-system-661a925a03593b6b61e82214) format. 
You can copy the contents of that file into dbdiagram.io to visualize the relationships.

## Running with Docker Compose

Use `docker-compose up` to start the API and a MySQL instance. The API will connect using the connection string defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
